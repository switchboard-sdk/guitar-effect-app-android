# Guitar Effect App for Android

*A guitar effect app is a software application designed for various platforms, such as iOS, Android, or computer systems, that allows guitarists and musicians to apply a diverse range of digital sound effects and processing techniques to alter the sound of their guitars in real-time. These effects can encompass everything from classic distortion and reverb to more intricate modulation and time-based effects, providing users with a versatile tool to experiment with and shape their instrument's tone according to their creative preferences and musical genre, often replicating the functionalities of physical guitar pedals or amplifiers in a digital format.*

The app has the following **features**:

- Applying different effects (e.g. Reverb, Compressor, Distortion) on the input signal sequentially.
- Taking the input signal from a guitar.
- Outputing the modified guitar signal to the device's speaker.
- Generating effect control UI components with Switchboard UI
